Magento-Lite-Aduroware_User
===========================

Frontend User Module for Magento Lite. Since Magento Lite has the customer module stripped out, this is a clone of the Customer module with it's symbols renamed as "User" or 'user*'. Use this if you need user authentication on the frontend of your Magento Lite Project.

This works from the frontend for the most part, but is still a work in progress.
